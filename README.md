# Mentor-Mentee-Android-Application
An interactive app has been designed consisting of four interfaces that will allow a smooth
communication among mentee, mentor, associate dean and hostel authority of the
university. Each interface comes with it's own set of functions. A mentee can apply for leave
of absence or register a complaint, while the mentor gets notified of each and every request
and complaint coming from his/her mentee. The associate dean is consulted by the mentor
while the hostel authority is intimidated and kept updated of every activity taking place.
